keeping notes

- talk about oop http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9582341/adding-new-properties-to-constructor-function-without-prototype#9582407
  - you can add functions to all strings by setting them on String.prototype
  - arrays too, same way
  - you can make your own cool types (CoolArray) kinda like this:

```javascript
function CoolArray () {}
CoolArray.prototype = Array
CoolArray.addAnAlp = function () { this.push('alp') }
```
